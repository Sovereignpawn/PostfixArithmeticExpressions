# PostfixArithmetixExpressions
A project that accepts an arithmetic expression of unsigned integers in postfix notation and builds the arithmetic expression tree that represents that expression. From that tree, the corresponding fully parenthesized infix expression is displayed and a file is generated that contains the three address format instructions.
